## Fuction of Summary Table

In the `Summary Table` menu, numerical variables are aggregated into **statistical tables**, and categorical variables are aggregated into **frequency tables** and **contingency tables**. And it is visualized to easily understand the distribution of variables.

- Statistical Table of Numerical Variables
- Frequency Table of Categorical Variables
- Contingency Table of Categorical Variables

### Statistical Table of Numerical Variables

Create statistical tables of numeric variables and visualize their distributions.

The summary table function is accessed through the menu system of **Descriptive Statistics > Summary Table > Statistical Table of Numerical Variables**.

<br>

#### Input widget for aggregation

- Target variable selection type:
    - Select one from `All` and `Custom` with the radio button.
    - All
        - By default, all numeric variables are selected for analysis.
    - User choose
        - The user selects a numeric variable to analyze.
        - If user selection is checked, 
        - a list box of `Numerical Variables(Choose one or more):` will appear.
- Numerical Variables(Choose one or more):
    - Appears only when `User choose` is specified in `Target variable selection type:`.
    - You can select one or more variables from any numeric variable.
- Statistics method:
    - Select the statistics to output to the summary table.
    - Choose from `missing`, `mean`, `standard deviation`, `skeweness`, `kurtosis`, `observation`, `SEM`, `IQR`.
    - `mean`, `standard deviation`, `skeweness`, `kurtosis` are selected by default.
- Quantiles method:
    - Select the quantiles to output to the summary table.
    - `min`, `Q1`, `median`, `Q3`, `max`, `1%th`, `5%th`, `10%th`, `20%th`, `30%th`, `40%th`, `60%th`, `70%th`, `80%th`, `90%th`, `95%th`, `99%th`에서 선택합니다.
    - `min`, `Q1`, `median`, `Q3`, `max` are selected by default.
- Calculate by category
    - This is a function that calculates a statistical table of numeric variables by grouping them by level of categorical variables.
    - Checking the check box widget will bring up the 'Categorical variables:' for categorical calculations.
- Categorical variables:
    - This function calculates the ssummary table of numeric variables by grouping them by level of categorical variables.
- Statistics digits:
    - Specifies the number of decimal places for the calculated statistics.
    - The default is 3, which is user-selectable.

    - Select whether to output a 'density plot' that can identify the distribution of numerical variables along with the statistical table.
    - If the check box is checked, the plot is also output.

<br>

#### Statistical table by default setting

Here, outputting a statistical table from the `Statistical Table of Numerical Variables` is assuming that `diamonds` data is selected in the `Dataset:` list box.

As the default setting of Descriptive Statistics > Summary Table > Statistical Table of Numerical Variables, if you click the `Execute` button, the **statistical table** is output in the right result area.

These default settings are:

- Target variable selection type:
    - All
- Statistics method:
    - `mean`, `standard deviation`, `skeweness`, `kurtosis`
- Quantiles method:
    - `min`, `Q1`, `median`, `Q3`, `max`
- Statistics digits:
    - 3

#### Statistical table by user-selected selection

Instead of all numeric variables, the user can select a numeric variable. This example selects the variables `caret`, `depth`, `table` and `price`.

![Widget to select numeric variables](img/table_select_num_variable_en.png)
<br>

The settings for the statistical table are now defined as follows:

- Target variable selection type:
    - User choose
- Numerical Variables(Choose one or more):
    - `caret`, `depth`, `table`, `price`
- Statistics method:
    - `mean`, `standard deviation`, `skeweness`, `kurtosis`
- Quantiles method:
    - `min`, `Q1`, `median`, `Q3`, `max`
- Statistics digits:
    - 3
  
When executed under the above conditions, the following statistical table is output.

![Statistical table with selected variables](img/table_select_variable_en.png)

<br>

#### Statistical table of numeric variables by category

If you check the `Calculate by category` check box, you can calculate the statistical table of numeric variables for each level of the selected categorical variable.

If you check the `Calculate by category` check box, a widget called `Categorical variables:` is displayed. Here you select the categorical variable `cut`.

![Select a list of categorical variables](img/table_select_cat_variable_en.png)

<br>

The settings for the statistical table are now defined as:

- Target variable selection type:
    - User choose
- Numerical Variables(Choose one or more):
    - `caret`, `depth`, `table`, `price`
- Statistics method:
    - `mean`, `standard deviation`, `skeweness`, `kurtosis`
- Quantiles method:
    - `min`, `Q1`, `median`, `Q3`, `max`
- Calculate by category
    - checked
- Categorical variables:  
    - `cut`
- Statistics digits:
    - 3

When executed under the above conditions, the following statistical table is output.

![Statistical table of numeric variables by categorical varables](img/table_groupby_variable_en.png)

<br>

#### Statistical table with visualization

Since the statistics table consists of several statistics, it is not easy to understand the distribution of the corresponding numeric variable. However, with visualization, it becomes easier to understand the distribution of numerical variables.

If you check the `Plot chart` check box, a `density plot` is output after the statistical table to understand the distribution of numerical variables.

The following is the result when the `Plot chart` check box is checked. Density plots are visualized for each selected numeric variable along with a statistical table.

![Statistical tables and plots](img/table_with_plot_en.png)

<br>

If you check the `Plot chart` check box and select a categorical variable, a density plot of the numeric variable is created, separated by level of the selected categorical variable.

    h4(icon("lightbulb", style = "margin-right: 5px;"), 
       "Solution", style = "margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 0px;"), 
    "According to the definition of multiple conditions, results from various viewpoints are output on one screen, so it is necessary to learn how to use individual input widgets. If the number of data is small, it runs with the default settings. Then change the condition to see how the result changes.")
