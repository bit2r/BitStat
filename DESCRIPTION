Description: A collection of tools that support data diagnosis, exploration, and 
    transformation and data analysis. 
    Data diagnostics provides information and visualization of missing values and outliers and 
    unique and negative values to help you understand the distribution and quality of your data. 
    Data exploration provides information and visualization of the descriptive statistics of 
    univariate variables, normality tests and outliers, correlation of two variables, and 
    relationship between target variable and predictor. Data transformation supports binning 
    for categorizing continuous variables, imputates missing values and outliers, resolving skewness. 
    And it creates automated reports that support these three tasks.
