  MINOR CHANGES:
    
    * The engine for i18n was changed from the shiny.i18n package to a 
      self-developed function. The reason is that an error occurred in the 
      logic for converting Hangul messages in MS-Windows.
    * The xlsx package was replaced with the openxlsx package for handling 
      excel files. This is because the openxlsx package is a package that 
      does not require JAVA.
