      in launch() when excute in MS-Windows 10. (thanks @statkclee, #1)

  MAJOR CHANGES:
    * Implement logic to get a matching alternative message by receiving 
      the value of a specific location as a parameter (#4) 
      
  MINOR CHANGES:
    * The engine for i18n was changed from the shiny.i18n package to a 
      self-developed function. The reason is that an error occurred in the 
      logic for converting Hangul messages in MS-Windows.
    * The xlsx package was replaced with the openxlsx package for handling 
      excel files. This is because the openxlsx package is a package that 
      does not require JAVA.
